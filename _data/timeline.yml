  from: 2020
  to: present
  description: I began UIUC as an undeclared student. My freshman year was kind of
               lame cause of COVID. I joined the marcing Illini and made plenty of
               friends my sophomore year though. During my major search, I hit a
               dead end. That is, until my roommate told me about iSchool. I looked
               into it and found a real place here. I wouldn't have done it any other
               way. I love where I am now and am planning on coming back to get my
               Master's next year.
