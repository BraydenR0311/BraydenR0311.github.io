description: Intro to the Website

If you're visiting this website, welcome! I hope to use this as a way to showcase my skills to anyone interested. Instead of just being all talk, hopefully this website can demonstrate some practical abilities in the fields I'm passionate about, be it data viz, machine learning, etc.

## The Project Page

The "Project" page is the main page where my work is showcased. It'll be a mix of passion projects and projects for classes I'm taking during my undergrad and grad years.

## That's it, so far!

Yeah. I hope to update this regularly and add all the things I'm proud about. Over the years, I'll build this to be an exhaustive portfolio of all the work I'd love to use in a career setting.
